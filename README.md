## overview ##
In this assignment, you will be putting together knowledge of writing multi-threaded programs (server and client), broadcast and multicast communication, and application-layer protocols. By the end of this assignment, you will have created a social media app consisting of one server and multiple clients. The clients all connect to the server who is then the means through which the clients are able to receive status updates from each other. A client (user) can post a status update that gets pushed as notification either to all other users (broadcasting) or to only a subset of users who are the userâ€™s friends (multicasting). We have split this entire assignment into three parts so as to walk you through progressively more sophisticated functionality.
